## Scratch Projects

We recommend using the online version of Scratch https://scratch.mit.edu/ (you need to register to save projects) although you can also download an offline version here: https://scratch.mit.edu/download. If you already have the offline version installed, make sure it is an up-to-date version using Scratch 3 not Scratch 2.

## Python Projects

We recommend using trinket https://trinket.io/ (you need to register to save projects) for projects that do not use pygame.

For projects that use pygame, we recommend Thonny which you can download here:  https://thonny.org/ You can then follow these instructions to install pygame: https://github.com/thonny/thonny/wiki/InstallingPackages
